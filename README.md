## First Commit (WORK IN PROGRESS)
With my first push to the repository, I am working on a simple GUI design for my fantasy sports drafting system's drafting process. With this push, I created a simple layout design to concentrate on the GUI's functionalities. I created the layout of the widgets and radio buttons to act as filters depending on the position the user chooses, which in turn will give the list of players at that selected position. 

I am currently adding the functionality of when a player is selected and then the "Draft chosen Player" is clicked, it moves that player chosen from the initial listbox to the user listbox.
